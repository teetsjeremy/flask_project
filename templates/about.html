    <h2>About</h2>

<p>The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.</p>

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds
            as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of the Five Armies.</p>

        <p class="lead">
            Oin (T.A. 2774 – 2994), elder son of Gróin, was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor. He and his younger brother Glóin were both born during the wanderings of their people, which followed the sack of Erebor. In 2802 they and their family settled in the Ered Luin (Blue Mountains). Nearly forty years later the two brothers joined the Quest of Erebor; they were counted on to start the campfires, though the brothers bickered over the task. Óin wears a brown hood.

As the result of the Quest, he received a share of the fabulous hoard of Erebor. He lived in Erebor for forty-seven years, until he joined Balin's expedition to recolonize Moria. There, as recorded in the Book of Mazarbul, he was killed by the Watcher in the Water while trying to escape via Moria's Western Door.

        <p class="lead">
            Gloin (T.A. 2783 – Fourth Age 15), son of Gróin, was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo Baggins on the Quest of Erebor, as was his older brother Óin. The two brothers were direct descendants of Durin the Deathless. Many years after the Quest, Glóin and his son Gimli were sent to Rivendell as an embassy from King Dáin II to bring news of Erebor, Moria, and what they knew of Sauron's plans; they arrived in time to attend the Council of Elrond.[14] He wears a white hood. The name Gloin is found in the Völuspá.

He was born during the wanderings of the Dwarves following the sack of Erebor. In T.A. 2790, the year he turned 7, his family had been living for a time in Dunland.[15] In T.A. 2802[16] he settled with his family in the Ered Luin, where he dwelt until the Quest; his son Gimli was born there.

As the result of the Quest, Glóin received a share of the fabulous hoard of Erebor, and he lived in the restored kingdom virtually the rest of his life.

        <p class="lead">
            Ori was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor. He was of Durin's House, a distant relative of Thorin Oakenshield. Ori, Dori and Nori form a sub-group within the company. All three played the flute. Ori wears a grey hood, and loves the arts.

He was also one of the Dwarves who, many years after the Quest, entered Moria with Balin. He was among the last members of Balin's colony to be killed (T.A. 2994), as is known by his entering the last records in the Book of Mazarbul before their final hopeless stand against the Orcs. This book was later discovered by the Fellowship of the Ring.

Ori's penmanship in the Book of Mazarbul suggests he was probably the scribe of Thorin & Co.'s letter at the start of the Quest of Erebor.

        <p class="lead">
            Dori was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor. Like other members of the company, his name comes directly from the Old Norse poem "Völuspá", part of the Poetic Edda; see also Dóri. Along with Nori and Ori, he was of Durin's House, a distant relative of Thorin Oakenshield. Dori is described as "a decent fellow, despite his grumbling", while Thorin mentions him as being the strongest member of the company. Dori wore a purple hood when he arrived at Bag End and played the flute at the Unexpected Party. Dori was held responsible for the well-being of the burglar several times; he carried Bilbo in the goblin-tunnels of the Misty Mountains, but unfortunately dropped the burglar, for which the other dwarves later blamed him. During the escape from the Wargs, Dori climbed down from a tree to help Bilbo, who could not get up on his own. Later, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as the company was carried off by the Eagles, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins. When Gandalf was telling the story of the company's adventures to Beorn, Dori and Thorin were the first two Dwarves to show up.

As the result of the Quest, Dori received a share of the fabulous hoard of Erebor, where he lived the rest of his days. He was alive and well many years after the Quest, as reported in The Fellowship of the Ring by Glóin to Frodo Baggins, on the eve of the Council of Elrond.

            Bifur was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor. Like other members of the company, his name comes directly from the Old Norse poem "Völuspá", part of the Poetic Edda; see also wikt:Bifurr. The forefathers of all the Dwarves of Thorin's company came from Moria, but (unlike the rest of the company) Bifur and his cousins Bofur and Bombur are not of the royal line of Durin.

Bifur was fond of raspberry jam and apple-tart at the unexpected party in Bag End, where he wore a yellow hood and played the clarinet. He gave the trolls quite a fight before getting sacked and helped to try to rescue Bilbo, and was set down uncomfortably near the fire as a reward.

As the result of the Quest, Bifur and his cousins each received a share of the fabulous hoard of Erebor, where they lived the rest of their days. They were all alive and well many years after the Quest, as reported in The Fellowship of the Ring by Glóin to Frodo Baggins, on the eve of the Council of Elrond.

The forefathers of all the Dwarves of Thorin's company came from Moria, but (unlike the rest of the company) Bofur, his younger brother Bombur and their cousin Bifur are not of the royal line of Durin,

Bofur sported a yellow hood, liked mince-pies and cheese at tea and like his cousin Bifur played the clarinet at the unexpected party in Bag End. He didn't have as rough a barrel-ride as most of his companions, but was still too stiff to help release the other dwarves following the escape from the Woodland Realm. Along with his brother Bombur he was nearly trapped at the bottom of a cliff on the Lonely Mountain after Smaug awoke before being rescued by the other dwarves.

As the result of the Quest, Bofur received a share of the fabulous hoard of Erebor, where he lived the rest of his days. He was alive and well many years after the Quest, as reported in The Fellowship of the Ring by Glóin to Frodo Baggins, on the eve of the Council of Elrond.

He wears a pale green hood and displays a special passion for food; he played a drum during the unexpected party in Bag End.

        <h3 class="featurette-heading">Gandalf</h3>
        <p class="lead">
            In T.A. 2941,[8] Gandalf arranged (and frequently accompanied) a band of 13 dwarves and the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to reclaim from Smaug the Dwarves' lost treasure in Erebor. To the quest, Gandalf contributed the map and key to Erebor. It was on this Quest of Erebor that Gandalf found his sword, Glamdring, in a troll's treasure hoard.

After escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and wargs, the party was carried to safety by the Great Eagles. Gandalf then persuaded Beorn—who did not like uninvited guests or dwarves—to house and provision the company for the trip through Mirkwood.

Gandalf left the company before they entered Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to. He turned up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seemed the Men of Esgaroth and the Mirkwood Elves would fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensued when hosts of goblins and wargs attacked all three parties. After the battle, Gandalf accompanied Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then, in an event only briefly described (in The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings), the Council "put forth its power" and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron, however, had anticipated this and withdrew as a feint, only to reappear in Mordor.
