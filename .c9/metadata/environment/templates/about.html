(T.A. 2774 – 2994), elder son of Gróin, was one of the twelve companions of Thorin and Bilbo on the Quest of Erebor. He and his younger brother Glóin were both born during the wanderings of their people, which followed the sack of Erebor. In 2802 they and their family settled in the Ered Luin (Blue Mountains). Nearly forty years later the two brothers joined the Quest of Erebor; they were counted on to start the campfires, though the brothers bickered over the task.
