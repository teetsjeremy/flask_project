Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in The Shire, Gandalf\n    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious Dwarves\n    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.</p>\n\n<div class=\"row featurette\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-7\">\n        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>\n        <p>Thorin II, also called the Oakenshield, King under the Mountain or the Mountain King, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli.

Dori is described as \"a decent fellow, despite his grumbling\", while Thorin mentions him as being the strongest member of the company. Dori wore a purple hood when he arrived at Bag End and played the flute at the Unexpected Party. Dori was held responsible for the well-being of the burglar several times; he carried Bilbo in the goblin-tunnels of the Misty Mountains, but unfortunately dropped the burglar, for which the other dwarves later blamed him. During the escape from the Wargs, Dori climbed down from a tree to help Bilbo, who could not get up on his own. Later, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as the company was carried off by the Eagles, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins.

To the quest, Gandalf contributed the map and key to Erebor. It was on this Quest of Erebor that Gandalf found his sword, Glamdring, in a troll's treasure hoard.\n\nAfter escaping from the Misty Mountains pursued by goblins and wargs, the party was carried to safety by the Great Eagles. Gandalf then persuaded Beorn—who did not like uninvited guests or dwarves—to house and provision the company for the trip through Mirkwood.\n\nGandalf left the company before they entered Mirkwood, saying that he had pressing business to attend to. He turned up again, however, before the walls of Erebor disguised as an old man, revealing himself when it seemed the Men of Esgaroth and the Mirkwood Elves would fight Thorin and the dwarves over Smaug's treasure. The Battle of Five Armies ensued when hosts of goblins and wargs attacked all three parties. After the battle, Gandalf accompanied Bilbo back to the Shire, revealing at Rivendell what his pressing business had been: Gandalf had once again urged the Council to evict Sauron, since quite evidently Sauron did not require the One Ring to continue to attract evil to Mirkwood. Then, in an event only briefly described (in The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings), the Council \"put forth its power\" and drove Sauron from Dol Guldur. Sauron, however, had anticipated this and withdrew as a feint, only to reappear in Mordor.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n{% endblock
